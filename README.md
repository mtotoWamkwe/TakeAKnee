# TakeAKnee

A simple android application.
TakeAKnee provides national anthems from various countries across the world. A user is able to scroll through the app and on identifying the national anthem they prefer to listen to they tap the button to play it.

The name is inspired by recent events where people/figures/role-models in society decided to protest their national anthem to bring awareness to a cause.

Also the application's architecture is inspired by the folks at Big Nerd Ranch Guide. Specifically their book Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (2nd edition).

Feel free to contribute. If your country is not represented reach out to us or just clone the repo and get your nation in on the action.
